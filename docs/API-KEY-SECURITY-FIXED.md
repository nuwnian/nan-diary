# 🔒 API Key Security - Fixed!

## ✅ What Was Fixed

Your Firebase API key was exposed in source code files that would be committed to GitHub. This has been secured.

## 🛡️ Current Security Setup

### Files Protected:
- ✅ `.env.local` - Contains your real API key (in `.gitignore`, never committed)
- ✅ `dashboard.html` - Now uses placeholder `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE`
- ✅ `src/js/config.js` - Now uses placeholder `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE`
- ✅ `deploy/` folder - In `.gitignore`, never committed

### How It Works:

1. **Local Development:**
   - Your real API key is stored in `.env.local` (ignored by git)
   - Run `npm run dev` to inject the key and start the dev server

2. **Build & Deploy:**
   - Run `npm run build` to create production files
   - Run `npm run deploy` to build and deploy to Firebase
   - The `inject-env.js` script automatically replaces placeholders with your real key during build

3. **Source Control:**
   - Only placeholder keys are committed to GitHub
   - Real keys stay in `.env.local` which is never committed

## 🚀 Commands to Use

### Development:
```bash
npm run dev          # Inject API key and start dev server
npm start            # Same as npm run dev
```

### Build:
```bash
npm run build        # Build with API key injection
```

### Deploy:
```bash
npm run deploy       # Build and deploy to Firebase
```

## ⚠️ BEFORE YOU COMMIT

**CRITICAL: Check that your API key is NOT in these files:**

```bash
# Run this check before committing:
git diff dashboard.html
git diff src/js/config.js
```

**You should see `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` NOT your real API key!**

## 🔐 If Your Key Was Already Exposed

If you already committed and pushed your API key to GitHub:

1. **Regenerate your API key in Firebase Console:**
   - Go to Firebase Console → Project Settings → General
   - Under "Your apps" → Web apps → Click your app
   - You can restrict or rotate your API key

2. **Update `.env.local` with the new key**

3. **Consider these Firebase security measures:**
   - Enable Firebase App Check
   - Set up proper Firestore security rules
   - Restrict API key to specific domains in Firebase Console

## 📝 Your Current .env.local

Your API key is safely stored in `.env.local`:
```
FIREBASE_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
```

This file is in `.gitignore` and will never be committed.

## ✨ You're Now Secure!

- ✅ API key stored in `.env.local` (not committed)
- ✅ Placeholders in source files (safe to commit)
- ✅ Automated injection during build/dev
- ✅ `deploy/` folder excluded from git

**You can now safely commit your changes!**
