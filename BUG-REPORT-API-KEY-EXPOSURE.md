# 🐛 Bug Report: API Key Exposure in Build System

## Issue Summary
**Severity**: 🔴 Critical Security Issue  
**Type**: Build System Vulnerability  
**Status**: ✅ Resolved  

Firebase API keys were being committed to the repository due to a flawed build process that modified source files instead of only deploy files.

## Problem Description

### What Happened
Every time `npm run build` was executed, the build system would:
1. ✅ Copy source files to `deploy/` directory (correct)
2. ❌ Replace placeholders with real API keys in **both** source AND deploy files (incorrect)
3. ❌ Developer commits source files containing real API keys (security breach)

### Root Cause
**File: `build-config.js`**
```javascript
// BUG: Modifying source files
const filesToUpdate = [
    'dashboard.html',           // ❌ SOURCE FILE
    'deploy/dashboard.html',    // ✅ DEPLOY FILE  
    'src/js/config.js',         // ❌ SOURCE FILE
    'deploy/src/js/config.js'   // ✅ DEPLOY FILE
];
```

## Impact
- 🚨 API key `[REDACTED_API_KEY]` exposed in repository
- 🚨 GitGuardian security alerts triggered
- 🚨 Potential unauthorized access to Firebase resources

## Solution

### 1. Fixed Build System
```javascript
// FIXED: Only modify deploy files
const filesToUpdate = [
    'deploy/dashboard.html',     // ✅ Deploy only
    'deploy/src/js/config.js'    // ✅ Deploy only
];
```

### 2. Environment Variable System
**Source files now use:**
```javascript
// Safe: Environment variable reference
"apiKey": process.env.FIREBASE_API_KEY || "SECURE_PLACEHOLDER_DO_NOT_COMMIT_REAL_KEY"
```

### 3. Secure Workflow
```
Source Files (git tracked) → Build Process → Deploy Files (git ignored)
[Placeholders Only]      →               → [Real API Keys]
```

## Testing

### Verify Fix
```bash
# 1. Build project
npm run build

# 2. Check source files are clean (should find nothing)
findstr "AIza" src\*.* dashboard.html

# 3. Check deploy files have real keys (only if env var set)
findstr "AIza" deploy\*.*
```

### Expected Results
- ✅ Source files: No API keys found
- ✅ Deploy files: Real API keys only when environment variable is set
- ✅ Git status: No sensitive changes to commit

## Prevention
1. **Never modify source files** in build process
2. **Use environment variables** for all secrets
3. **Deploy directory** must be git-ignored
4. **Regular security scans** with GitGuardian

## Recovery Actions Taken
1. ✅ Removed API keys from all source files
2. ✅ Fixed build system logic
3. ✅ Implemented environment variable system
4. ✅ Updated `.gitignore` patterns
5. 🔄 **TODO**: Revoke exposed API key in Google Cloud Console
